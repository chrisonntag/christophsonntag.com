The aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic forced a lot of institutions that offer public 
spaces (like university libraries) to ensure that only a certain number of people use it at the same time. 
The [University of Passau](https://www.uni-passau.de) estimated the number of available space in a library using 
thermosensitive sensors. 

This is an iOS Homescreen widget that uses this data and is available on my [GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/chrisonntag/645d782bd9e48a71c6c2b84b21cfb734).
It's written in Javascript for the Scriptable app.
